# diy-lenticular

A guide on 3D lenticular printing.  This workflow could probably be improved upon, but hopefully it helps others. 

## Pre Requisites

### Required Hardware

* A good quality inkjet printer, higher DPI is better - I have a used Canon Pro-100 I got on FB marketplace.
* Mac or Windows computer
* Lenticular sheet with an adhesive backing - I got [this on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BY2JF23B)
* Glossy photo paper to print on - I used [this paper](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XCNBT8K) with an adhesive back to make stickers.
* Scissors
* Moderate amount of hand-eye coordination

### Optional Hardware
* Rubber Brayer - Helps with getting the bubbles out of the sheet
* Guillotine Paper Trimmer (or similar) - Helps cutting the sheet to size

## Software

* Blender - https://www.blender.org/download/
* GIMP - https://www.gimp.org/
* Grape (Adware Version) - https://www.pop3dart.com/grape-10-software
* Official drivers for your printer

## Guide

Lenticular printing can be divided in to two main steps, the first is designing and rendering an interlaced image.   The second is printing and combining the image with the lenticular sheet.   

### Design and Rendering in Blender

To start with we'll need to create our scene in Blender, set up cameras, and then render out a series of images.   These images will then be used to create the interlaced image to print with Grape.

I have an example project here -

### Creating the Interlaced Image

### Printing the Image

### Sticking Lenticular Sheet to Image
